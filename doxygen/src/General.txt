\mainpage Overview

<b>Open-CMSIS-Pack</b> describes a delivery mechanism for software components, device parameters, and evaluation board
support. The XML-based package description (PDSC) file describes the content of a software pack (file collection) that
includes:
 -  Source code, header files, and software libraries
 -  Documentation and source code templates
 -  Device parameters along with startup code and programming algorithms
 -  Example projects

The complete file collection along with the PDSC file is shipped in ZIP-format (renamed to *.pack). The PDSC file is designed
for software development environments and describes the user and device relevant context for the files supplied within such
a pack file. This information can also be used for display on web sites (refer to \ref createPackPublish).

The CMSIS-Pack system solves several problems:

- It provides meta-data of files that relate to a software component. All files that belong to a software component can be
  identified and information about the original provider is preserved.
- It enables consistent software component upgrade and identifies incompatible configuration files that may be part of the
  user application.
- Software component providers can specify the interfaces and relationship to other software components.
- The meta-data of a software component can include dependency information for toolchains, devices, and processors which
  simplifies the integration into application programs.

After installing a software pack, all included software components are available to the development
tools. Software components are a collection of source modules, header and configuration files as well as
libraries. Packs containing software components can also include \ref pdsc_examples_pg "examples" and user code templates.

The \subpage pack_revisionHistory lists the main changes between versions.


\section SWPackVariants Software pack use cases

A software pack can be used to deliver:

- \b Device \b support: a so called <i>Device Family Pack (DFP)</i> contains CMSIS system/startup files, drivers, and flash
  algorithms for a microcontroller device family.
- \b Board \b support: a <i>Board Support Pack (BSP)</i> contains documentation, schematics, and drivers for a certain
  development board.
- \b Software \b components: a pure <i>software pack</i> can contain source code, libraries, and documentation for:
  - \b middleware \b stacks for public availability.
  - \b in-house \b software for distribution within a company and/or engineering group.

All these pack types can contain in addition:

- example projects,
- code templates,
- reference applications.

As shown in the image below, a software pack can address multiple use cases at the same time! The
\ref packFormat "XML elements" in the PDSC file determine the use case(s).
<a class="el" href="https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_6/latest/General/index.html#cmsis_components" target="_blank">CMSIS</a>
itself is distributed in various software packs (CORE, DSP library, RTOS implementation, etc.) and is supplied by Arm.

The following sections provide more information:

 - In the \ref cp_Packs, learn the basics and the required steps for creating a pack.
 - \ref packFormat describes all XML elements that can be used in a package description file.
 - \ref configWizard can be used to create GUI-like elements in development tools for configuration files.
 - \ref flashAlgorithm algorithms are used to erase or download applications to Flash devices.
 - \ref coresight_setup allows to create tool-agnostic debug and trace configurations.
 - \ref sdf_pg describes all XML elements that can be used in a system description file for debugging.

\note
The <a href="https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/pack-tools/">CMSIS-Toolbox documentation</a> provides in-depth
documentation about how to create a CMSIS-Pack. It contains links to pack tutorial repos (for DFP, BSP, and generic software
packs) and provides useful tips when creating a pack.
